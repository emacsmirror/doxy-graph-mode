#+TITLE: Emacs doxy-graph minor mode 

=doxy-graph-mode= links source code to doxygen call graphs.

It allows to interactivelly see the call graph or the inverted call
graph of a given function or method from source code.

* Requirements

- emacs 24.5 (or newer).
- doxygen 1.8.13 (or newer).

* Usage

Firts of all you have to generate doxygen latex documentation
including call graphs. To carry out this you can generate a =Doxyfile=
config file with the command =doxygen -g= in your source code path.

It is necessary to change the following settings inside =Doxyfile=.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
CALL_GRAPH             = YES

CALLER_GRAPH           = YES
#+END_SRC

An example of =Doxyfile= is given in this repository.

You can invoque ~doxy-graph-mode~ commad =M x doxy-graph-mode=.

When mini mode is active you can position the cursor over function
name and visualize call graph and inverted call graph.

latex folder. You can choose doxygen latex folder using the directory
chooser.

Calling the interactive function =doxy-graph-set-latex-path= you can
