config file with the command =doxygen -g= in your source code path.

It is necessary to change the following settings inside =Doxyfile=.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
CALL_GRAPH             = YES

CALLER_GRAPH           = YES
#+END_SRC

An example of =Doxyfile= is given in this repository.

You can invoque ~doxy-graph-mode~ commad =M x doxy-graph-mode=.

When mini mode is active you can position the cursor over function
name and visualize call graph and inverse call graph.
